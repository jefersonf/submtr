**submtr** is a command-line interface (CLI) tool written in Go, designed to automate the process of fetching competitive programming problem sets, specifically from AtCoder.


Usage
```sh
go run main.go -c=abc404
```

By default problem set A-G are fetched but you can also specify a range.


```sh
go run main.go -c=abc404 -r=a-c
```
